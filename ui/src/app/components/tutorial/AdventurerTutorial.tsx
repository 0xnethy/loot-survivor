        Adventurers are the gate to playing Loot Survivor. You must create one
        with a unique name, realm id, and choose a starting weapon. This will
        follow you through your game journey until you die.
      </p>
      <p>
        Select your adventurer's persona. Remember, there is no limit to the
        number of adventurers you can spawn!
