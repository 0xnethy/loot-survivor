      <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg mb-1">
        You will first need to create your very own Adventurer. Think of it as
        stepping into a pair of sturdy boots that will carry you across the vast
        expanses of our eerie world until the very end. Each Adventurer costs 50
        LORDS. There&apos;s absolutely no limit to the number of Adventurers you
        can conjure up!
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg mb-1">
        To bring your Adventurer to life, you&apos;ll need a unique name, home
        Realm, race and of course, your initial weapon of choice. This will be
        your identity throughout your journey.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg mb-1">
        Once your Adventurer is minted, a world of opportunities opens up.
        You&apos;ll be able to perform a range of actions to help them climb the
        ranks and achieve the glory they deserve.

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-lg mb-1">Are you ready to survive?</p>
